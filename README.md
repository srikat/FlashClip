[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/gityeop/FlowClip)](https://github.com/gityeop/FlowClip/releases/latest)

**FlowClip** allows you to keep the existing powerful features of Maccy while leveraging the new **Queue Clipboard** capability. Copied items are stored in history for easy access, and you can now perform batch operations with ease.

FlowClip is a fork of [Maccy](https://maccy.app), keeping it lightweight, fast, and open-source.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Queue Clipboard (New!)
Copy multiple items one after another and paste them sequentially or all at once.

- **Batch Copy**: Copy text or images multiple times to build a queue.
- **Sequential Paste**: Paste items in the order they were queued (FIFO).
- **Custom Separators**: When pasting all items, choose to separate them with a space, new line, comma, or any custom character.
- **Visual Queue**: View and manage your queued items in a dedicated floating window.

### Core Features (inherited from Maccy)
- Lightweight & Fast
- Keyboard-first navigation
- Secure & Private
- Native UI (macOS standard)
