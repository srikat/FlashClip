**FlowClip** allows you to keep the existing powerful features of Maccy while leveraging the new **Queue Clipboard** capability. With FlowClip, you can easily perform batch operations.

FlowClip is a fork of [Maccy](https://maccy.app), keeping it lightweight, fast, and open-source.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Queue Clipboard (New!)
Copy multiple items one after another and paste them sequentially or all at once.

- **Batch Copy**: Copy text or images multiple times to build a queue.
- **Sequential Paste**: Paste items in the order they were queued (FIFO).
- **Custom Separators**: When pasting all items, choose to separate them with a space, new line, comma, or any custom character.
- **Visual Queue**: View and manage your queued items in a dedicated floating window.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **To use Queue Clipboard:** You must grant **Accessibility permissions** to FlowClip in System Settings. Please **restart the app** after granting permission.

### Core Features (inherited from Maccy)
- Lightweight & Fast
- Keyboard-first navigation
